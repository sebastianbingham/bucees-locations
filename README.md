# Buc-ee's Locations Directory

This repository contains a structured and human-readable list of Buc-ee's store locations across the United States.

## Source

All information is copied from Buc-ee's official public website: [https://buc-ees.com/locations](https://buc-ees.com/locations).

The store numbers (`id` field) are taken directly from the labels used on the website. These numbers may not represent actual internal store identifiers.

## Files Included

- `bucees_locations_final.json` — Cleaned and structured JSON file with all Buc-ee's locations, including store ID, name, and address.
- `bucees_locations.md` — Markdown version of the store list, formatted for easy reading or web publishing.

## Format

Each entry in the JSON file includes:
- `id`: Store number as listed on the website
- `name`: City and state of the store
- `address`: Full physical address

The Markdown file presents the same data in a readable format, ideal for documentation or websites.
